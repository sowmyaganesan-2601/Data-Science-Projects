Step 1: Local Development with Apache Spark
Goal: Run market basket analysis (FP-Growth) using Spark locally first.

Tasks:

Load your CSV data into Spark.
Preprocess it (cleaning, formatting, aggregation).
Run FP-Growth to identify frequent itemsets and association rules.
Store the final results in a CSV file or local storage for now.

Step 2: Upload Results to Amazon S3
Goal: Store the results from Spark in Amazon S3 for cloud-based access.

Tasks:

After running the analysis locally, upload the final results to an S3 bucket.

Use the AWS S3 Python SDK (boto3) to upload files to S3.

Step 3: Query Results with Amazon Athena
Goal: Use Amazon Athena to query your results stored in S3 using SQL.

Tasks:

Set up Athena and point it to your S3 bucket.

Create a database and table in Athena for the data.

Run SQL queries on the data to explore insights, filter results, or prepare for dashboards.

Step 4: Create Dashboards with Amazon QuickSight or Power BI
Goal: Visualize the results stored in S3 using Amazon QuickSight or Power BI.

Tasks:

If using QuickSight, connect it to your Athena database (QuickSight supports Athena as a data source).

If using Power BI, connect to Athena via the ODBC driver.

Build interactive dashboards showing the most frequent itemsets, rules, and other insights.

Step 5: Automate the Pipeline with Apache Airflow
Goal: Automate the entire workflow (ingest data → analyze → store results → update dashboard).

Tasks:

Set up Apache Airflow on your local machine or cloud environment.

Create DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to automate the steps:

Ingest new transaction data (from local files or S3).

Run the Spark analysis.

Upload results to S3.

Trigger QuickSight or Power BI updates.

You can schedule the entire pipeline to run daily, weekly, or on a custom schedule.

Final Workflow Summary:
Run Spark Locally: Preprocess and run FP-Growth on the transaction data.

Upload Results to S3: Store your results in Amazon S3.

Query with Athena: Use SQL queries in Amazon Athena to analyze the data.

Build Dashboards: Visualize the results in QuickSight or Power BI.

Automate with Airflow: Schedule the entire process for recurring tasks.
